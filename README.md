## Ultimate React Design Patterns for High Performance

This is the repository for [Ultimate React Design Patterns for High Performance](https://orangeava.com/products/ultimate-react-design-patterns-for-high-performance), published by Orange AVA™

## About the Book
React has become the cornerstone of modern web development, powering user interfaces for startups, global platforms, and enterprise systems alike. Ultimate React Design Patterns for High Performance is your roadmap to mastering the advanced concepts needed to build scalable, maintainable, and production-ready applications.

The book begins with foundational patterns such as layout, container, controlled, and uncontrolled components, giving you confidence in structuring applications the right way. It then progresses to higher-order components, custom hooks, and functional programming techniques, equipping you to write reusable, reliable, and testable code. Each chapter builds on the last, steadily guiding you from intermediate knowledge to senior-level expertise.

Beyond patterns, you will learn performance optimization with memoization, state management strategies, and clean coding principles for scalable architecture. You will also design consistent, enterprise-ready UIs using Figma and component libraries. The final section explores advanced TypeScript, showing how to strongly type hooks, reducers, generics, and component patterns for safer, maintainable code.

By the end, you will not only understand advanced React concepts but also be able to architect applications the React way—clean, scalable, optimized, and production-ready. Thus, whether your goal is to advance from junior to senior engineer, deliver enterprise-grade apps, or simply master React at a deeper level, this book will give you the skills and mindset to succeed.
